# Relational Database for a Professional Social Network

This project was developed as part of the **Data Engineering** course and focuses on the design and implementation of a relational database system inspired by professional social networks like LinkedIn.

The main objective was to transform a denormalized dataset—initially containing mixed user, post, and reaction data—into a well-structured, normalized relational database. The final model supports key relationships and constraints while ensuring data integrity and consistency.
